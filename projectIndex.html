        <h4>Mercedes-AMG A45S - From £50,570</h4>

        <p>The Mercedes-AMG A45 S is a four-wheel-drive hot hatchback that costs more than £50,000 and has a 2.0-litre four-pot that makes 416bhp and 369lb ft. Not only does that mean Affalterbach’s most rabid hot hatch has the most powerful series production four-cylinder motor on the planet, it also has a motor with a higher specific output than that of a Ferrari 488 Pista. It is, in a sense, utterly ridiculous.</p>

          <p>Be that as it may, there’s still a phenomenal (not to mention usable) driver’s car lying beneath all its wings, fins and flares. Straight-line performance is undoubtedly immense, but more of a surprise is how well-mannered its complex, steroidal driveline is when simply tooling about. Body control is rock solid at speed, but there’s genuine compliance in the chassis too. Grip, meanwhile, is outstanding; and the accuracy, weighting and textural feedback from its electrically-assisted steering rack is easily up there with the best in class.</p>
            
            <p>As a multi-talented hot hatchback, the A45 S is undoubtedly a triumph. But priced as it now is up beyond £50,000, it has wandered so far from the realms of relative affordability that hot hatchbacks are supposed to champion that crowning it class champion would have been a touch problematic. Still, what a fantastic machine it is.</p>

        <h4>Volkswagen Golf R - From £41,060</h4>

        <p>Volkswagen's highly regarded super-Golf, the four-wheel drive Golf R, has taken a big step forward in this latest form. Unlike twenty years ago, when the V6-engined R32 vied with the Alfa Romeo 147 GTA to be the very hottest of hot hatchbacks that could be bought with a full factory warranty, the latest one isn't quite the fiercest car of its kind. Its 316bhp 2.0-litre turbocharged engine gives it bragging rights over its VW Group in-house rivals, but not quite over other key German opponents.</p>

        <p>But it has other weapons. Having been made stiffer-sprung, wider and better-braked in this form than it has been before, the Golf R now combines adaptive dampers at each corner with a fully torque-vectored four-wheel drive system that can juggle drive not just front-to-rear but also asymmetrically across its rear axle. Tick the right options boxes and the car will even offer 'drift mode'.</p>

        <p>The car has taken on a slightly different character as a mk 8 Golf than it had as a mk 7. While the just-so compromise of suppleness, stability and pace that made the last version of the car so popular has gone, even greater body control and adhesion has come in to make up the balance - and greater driver involvement too, albeit only if you really probe at the car's limits. For those who liked the 'one fast car for every journey' charm of the mk 7, the mk 8 may feel a little too serious, and perhaps just a touch aloof at lower speeds. But there's no denying that the car's outright dynamic capabilities have expanded by quite a way.</p>

    <h4>Audi RS3 - From £52,520</h4>

    <p>There’s an interesting thing going on here, in that initially, the RS3 felt a little bit all over the place. There’s a deeply impressive car here, buried under a landslide of data, adjustability, and the choice that it brings with it. Layers upon layers of individualisation, for every different surface, road and need. And while it searches for perfection, what the RS3 does is put the onus on the driver to pick the right combination. But when you do, it’s brilliant. A really good car on the right kind of wrong road.</p>

    <p>So is this the best megahatch on the market? Well, the main competition comes from the Mercedes-AMG A45 S, a similarly-speedy, similarly-priced 400-ish bhp AWD hatchback. But they’re actually quite different. Where the Merc is angry and pointy and hard, the Audi is more cultured, better damped and much less aggressive. It’s certainly not slower though - and especially not on a bouncy b-road - this is probably as fast an A to B point car down an unknown road as you’re likely to get short of something with rally stickers and a ‘cage.</p>

    <p>It’s not as visceral as something like the Merc - despite being the same power and also AWD - but the fact that it feels like it’s more on your side makes it just as quick. You’ll feel like you’re going faster in the A45, but I doubt you will be. More than that though, the RS3 now feels like it’s starting to get really comfortable in its own skin; it’s a confident, worthwhile, capable car, with a side order of madness not far off. Just don’t spec it in Kyalami green.</p>

        <h4>BMW M135i - From £38,470</h4>

        <p>You might think it odd that a 50 per cent drop in engine cylinders and a switch away from rear-wheel drive should have made the performance version of the new BMW 1-Series, the M135i xDrive, a better hot hatchback – but in many cases, that’s what happened.</p>

        <p>By better, we clearly don’t mean more powerful or, at its very best, more exciting. The old M140i’s powertrain and chassis certainly both had their moments, but the M135i xDrive became a more composed performance car, easier to drive, faster along a testing stretch of B-road, and more communicating of its adhesive limits, when it came along in 2019.</p>

        <p>BMW then refined the car's handling and specification, chucked away half of the four-wheel drive system, and gave birth to the 128ti in 2020: a car whose auto-only driveline is a bit of a turn-off and which doesn't excite as viscerally as some cars in this class, but which has plenty of high-speed purpose about it. If you like your hot hatchbacks desirable, usable and a shade more dynamically sophisticated than the norm, the 128ti is worth considering.</p>
